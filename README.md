# TDP-43 dependent Alternative Polyadenylation Analysis

## Abstract

This repository code used to create figures in each figure. By analyzing 3' end-sequencing data from TDP-43 knockdown experiments, we found significant alterations in 3' UTR processing and polyadenylation site selection. Our findings demonstrate that TDP-43 plays a crucial role in APA regulation, with implications for understanding neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and FTD where TDP-43 dysfunction is prevalent.

### Figure Generation

The code for generating plots in the manuscript is also included and organized as follows in `Figures` folder. The sample information is hard coded for our specific dataset, so to adapt it to your own data, you'll need to make the changes in these files.
